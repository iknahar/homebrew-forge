    Forge is not yet notarized by Apple. On first launch macOS will
    block it with "Apple could not verify Forge is free of malware".

    Approve it once:
      System Settings -> Privacy & Security ->
      "Forge was blocked..." -> Open Anyway

    Or strip the quarantine flag from Terminal:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Forge.app
  EOS
end
